## Description

This is the second project for [Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011). The aim of this project is to understand how to manipulate the DOM and add contents dynamically to the page. Used Udacity's starter code for HTML and CSS and I wrote JavaScript to make its static page dynamic.

* Dynamically add sections in the function `createNewSections()` which implements a `for` loop for `.createElement()` and `.appendChild()`.
* Dynamically create navigation bar with list items that correspond to each section in the function `generateNav()` using a `forEach` loop.
* Highlight above list items when corresponding sections are in the viewport in the function `makeActive()`.
* Add smooth scroll to anchor ID in the function `smoothScroll()`, using a `forEach` loop and a click `.addEventListener()` to prevent a default scrolling event and add smooth behavior instead.
* Add smooth scroll to the top button in the function `scrollToTheTop`.
